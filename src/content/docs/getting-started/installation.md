Welcome to Pollora! This guide will help you get a working installation up and running. Pollora is a WordPress framework built on top of Laravel — it replaces WordPress's frontend templating with Laravel's Blade engine while keeping WordPress's full backend (admin, database, plugins).

## Requirements

- PHP 8.3 or higher
- Composer 2.x
- MySQL 5.7+ / MariaDB 10.3+ / SQLite
- Node.js and NPM (for theme asset bundling)
- [DDEV](https://ddev.readthedocs.io) (optional, for a ready-made local environment)

## Current release

Pollora's version numbers follow the Laravel release it is built on. The current release is **v13.32.0-beta.2**, built on Laravel 13.32.

Because it is a pre-release, Composer never selects it by default: a plain `composer create-project pollora/pollora` still installs the last stable release (v13.4.0). The commands below ask for the beta explicitly.

## Installation Methods

Pollora offers two ways to create a project:

1. The Pollora CLI (recommended)
2. Composer `create-project`

Both end up running the same interactive setup, which you can also [run by hand](#running-the-setup-manually).

### 1. Pollora CLI

Install the CLI globally once:

```bash
composer global require pollora/cli
```

Make sure Composer's global `vendor/bin` directory is in your `PATH` — `composer global config bin-dir --absolute` prints it. Then create a project:

```bash
pollora new example-app
```

Or let the CLI provision a full local environment with DDEV (recommended):

```bash
pollora new example-app --ddev
```

With `--ddev`, the CLI configures DDEV (WordPress project type, PHP 8.4, MariaDB 10.11), starts it, installs the project inside the container, writes the database credentials to `.env`, and runs the WordPress installation. Your site is then available at `https://example-app.ddev.site`.

#### CLI options

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--ddev` | Set up the project with DDEV |
| `--force`, `-f` | Force install even if the directory already exists |
| `--git` | Initialize a Git repository |
| `--branch=NAME` | Branch name for the new repository (default: `main`) |
| `--ver=VERSION` | Install a specific version or constraint (e.g. `13.32.0-beta.2`, `^13.32@beta`) |
| `--stable` | Install the latest stable release instead of the latest pre-release |

`pollora new` installs the latest release **including pre-releases**, so you get v13.32.0-beta.2 today. Pass `--stable` to stay on the last stable release, or `--ver` to pin an exact version.

### 2. Composer create-project

```bash
composer create-project "pollora/pollora:^13.32@beta" example-app
```

The `@beta` flag is what allows Composer to pick the current pre-release. To install the last stable release instead, drop the constraint:

```bash
composer create-project pollora/pollora example-app
```

Either command will:

1. Create a new Pollora project
2. Install all dependencies
3. Automatically launch the LaunchPad setup process

During the setup, you'll be prompted for:

#### Environment Configuration (pollora:env:setup)

- **Site URL**: Your site's URL (e.g., https://example.com)
- **Database Configuration**:
    - Host (default: localhost)
    - Port (default: 3306)
    - Database name
    - Username
    - Password

The system will test the database connection. If it fails, you'll have the option to retry with different credentials.

#### WordPress Installation (pollora:install)

- **Site Information**:
    - Site title
    - Site description
    - Language selection (searchable list of available languages)
- **Admin Account**:
    - Username
    - Email
    - Password (minimum 8 characters)
- **Search Engine Visibility**:
    - Option to allow or prevent search engine indexing
- **Theme**: the name of the theme generated from `pollora/theme-default` (defaults to `default`)

## Running the setup manually

If you prefer to run the installation steps yourself — or need to re-run them — use the following Artisan commands:

```bash
# Configure environment
php artisan pollora:env:setup

# Install WordPress
php artisan pollora:install
```

These commands guide you through the same interactive setup as the automatic installation.

### Non-Interactive Installation

For automated deployments, CI/CD pipelines, or scripted setups, you can bypass the interactive prompts by passing all required options directly:

```bash
php artisan pollora:install \
    --title="My Site" \
    --description="A Pollora-powered site" \
    --admin-user=admin \
    --admin-email=admin@example.com \
    --admin-password=secretpassword \
    --locale=en_US \
    --public=true \
    --theme=default
```

Available options:

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--title` | Site title |
| `--description` | Site description |
| `--admin-user` | Admin username |
| `--admin-email` | Admin email address |
| `--admin-password` | Admin password (min. 8 characters) |
| `--locale` | Site locale (e.g. `en_US`, `fr_FR`) |
| `--public` | Allow search engine indexing (`true` or `false`) |
| `--theme` | Name of the theme to generate (defaults to `default`) |
| `--install` | Suppress informational output for automated runs |

Any option that is omitted will trigger its corresponding interactive prompt. This means you can mix CLI options and prompts — for example, provide the title and admin credentials via options while being prompted for language selection.

## Web-based Installation

If you prefer the traditional WordPress installation interface, you can:

1. Run the environment setup:
```bash
php artisan pollora:env:setup
```

2. Once the `.env` file is configured, visit your site's URL and follow the WordPress installation wizard.

## Post-Installation Verification

After successful installation:

1. Start the development server: `php artisan serve` (or, with DDEV, just open `https://example-app.ddev.site`)
2. Access your site at the configured URL
3. Access your WordPress admin panel at: `your-site-url/wp-admin`
4. Verify you can log in with the admin credentials you configured

For post-installation configuration (WordPress settings, environment variables, development environments), see the [Configuration](/getting-started/configuration/) guide.
