Welcome to Pollora! This guide will help you get a working installation up and running. Pollora is a WordPress framework built on top of Laravel — it replaces WordPress's frontend templating with Laravel's Blade engine while keeping WordPress's full backend (admin, database, plugins).

## Requirements

- PHP 8.3 or higher
- Composer 2.x
- MySQL 5.7+ / MariaDB 10.3+ / SQLite
- Node.js and NPM (for theme asset bundling)

## Installation Methods

Pollora offers three ways to install your application:

1. Automatic installation via Composer (recommended)
2. Manual installation via Artisan commands
3. Web-based installation after environment setup

### 1. Automatic Installation

The recommended way to install Pollora is using Composer:

```bash
composer create-project pollora/pollora example-app
```

This command will:
1. Create a new Pollora project
2. Install all dependencies
3. Automatically launch the LaunchPad setup process

During the setup, you'll be prompted for:

#### Environment Configuration (pollora:env-setup)

- **Site URL**: Your site's URL (e.g., https://example.com)
- **Database Configuration**:
    - Host (default: localhost)
    - Port (default: 3306)
    - Database name
    - Username
    - Password

The system will test the database connection. If it fails, you'll have the option to retry with different credentials.

#### WordPress Installation (pollora:install)

- **Site Information**:
    - Site title
    - Site description
    - Language selection (searchable list of available languages)
- **Admin Account**:
    - Username
    - Email
    - Password (minimum 8 characters)
- **Search Engine Visibility**:
    - Option to allow or prevent search engine indexing

### 2. Manual Installation via Artisan

If you prefer to run the installation steps manually, you can use the following Artisan commands:

```bash
# Configure environment
php artisan pollora:env-setup

# Install WordPress
php artisan pollora:install
```

These commands will guide you through the same interactive setup process as the automatic installation.

#### Non-Interactive Installation

For automated deployments, CI/CD pipelines, or scripted setups, you can bypass the interactive prompts by passing all required options directly:

```bash
php artisan pollora:install \
    --title="My Site" \
    --description="A Pollora-powered site" \
    --admin-user=admin \
    --admin-email=admin@example.com \
    --admin-password=secretpassword \
    --locale=en_US \
    --public=true
```

Available options:

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--title` | Site title |
| `--description` | Site description |
| `--admin-user` | Admin username |
| `--admin-email` | Admin email address |
| `--admin-password` | Admin password (min. 8 characters) |
| `--locale` | Site locale (e.g. `en_US`, `fr_FR`) |
| `--public` | Allow search engine indexing (`true` or `false`) |
| `--install` | Suppress informational output for automated runs |

Any option that is omitted will trigger its corresponding interactive prompt. This means you can mix CLI options and prompts — for example, provide the title and admin credentials via options while being prompted for language selection.

### 3. Web-based Installation

If you prefer the traditional WordPress installation interface, you can:

1. Run the environment setup:
```bash
php artisan pollora:env-setup
```

2. Once the `.env` file is configured, visit your site's URL and follow the WordPress installation wizard.

## Post-Installation Verification

After successful installation:

1. Start the development server: `php artisan serve`
2. Access your site at the configured URL
3. Access your WordPress admin panel at: `your-site-url/wp-admin`
4. Verify you can log in with the admin credentials you configured

For post-installation configuration (WordPress settings, environment variables, development environments), see the [Configuration](/getting-started/configuration/) guide.
