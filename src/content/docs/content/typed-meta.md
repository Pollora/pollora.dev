In WordPress, a meta is a string key and a string value: its key is repeated wherever it is read or written, and every read casts it again by hand. Pollora lets you declare a meta once, as a typed PHP property, and derives the rest: `register_meta()`, sanitization, the REST schema, and reads and writes with the PHP type.

> **Experimental.** The API may still change before it is declared stable. Projects that do not use `#[Meta]` see no change.

## Declaring meta

A meta is a public typed property marked `#[Meta]`, on the class that already carries `#[PostType]` or `#[Taxonomy]`. The property type gives the meta type, its initial value the default, and its name the key, in snake_case:

```php
use App\Enums\EventStatus;
use Carbon\CarbonImmutable;
use Pollora\Attributes\Meta;
use Pollora\Attributes\PostType;
use Pollora\Attributes\PostType\ShowInRest;
use Pollora\Attributes\PostType\Supports;

#[PostType('event')]
#[ShowInRest]
#[Supports(['title', 'editor', 'custom-fields'])]
class Event
{
    #[Meta(showInRest: true, label: 'Start')]
    public ?CarbonImmutable $startsAt = null;     // key: starts_at

    #[Meta(showInRest: true)]
    public int $capacity = 0;

    #[Meta(showInRest: true)]
    public bool $soldOut = false;

    #[Meta(showInRest: true)]
    public EventStatus $status = EventStatus::Draft;   // a backed enum

    #[Meta(key: '_event_internal_ref', capability: 'manage_options')]
    public ?string $internalRef = null;
}
```

Taxonomies work the same way: the meta are registered on the taxonomy's terms.

```php
use Pollora\Attributes\Meta;
use Pollora\Attributes\Taxonomy;

#[Taxonomy('genre')]
class Genre
{
    #[Meta(showInRest: true)]
    public ?string $color = null;
}
```

Each property needs a default value or a nullable type: it is what an absent meta reads as. The meta are registered on `init`, after post types and taxonomies, and declaring a class is all it takes — run `php artisan discovery:clear` after adding one in development.

### `#[Meta]` parameters

| Parameter | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `key` | property name in snake_case | Key stored in the database: `startsAt` is stored as `starts_at` |
| `showInRest` | `false` | Exposes the meta in the REST API, with a schema derived from its type |
| `label` | none | Label shown by the editor |
| `description` | none | Description passed to `register_meta()` |
| `sanitize` | derived from the type | A callable (`'wp_kses_post'`, `[MyClass::class, 'method']`) replacing the sanitization |
| `capability` | the right to edit the post or term | Capability required to write the meta through REST and the editor |
| `revisions` | `false` | Versions the meta with post revisions (post types only; the post type needs `revisions` support) |

### Types

| PHP type | Stored as | Sanitized with |
|---|---|---|
| `string` | as is | `sanitize_text_field()` — use `sanitize: 'wp_kses_post'` for HTML |
| `int` | `"250"` | conversion to an integer |
| `float` | `"9.5"` | conversion to a number |
| `bool` | `"1"` or `"0"` | `1`, `true`, `yes`, `on` / `0`, `false`, `no`, `off` |
| `DateTimeInterface`, Carbon | ISO 8601 in UTC: `2026-11-14T09:00:00+00:00` | parsed; a value that is not a date is emptied |
| backed enum | the case value | `tryFrom()`; an unknown value is emptied |

A nullable type (`?int`) allows the meta to be absent. A date property typed with an interface (`DateTimeInterface`, `CarbonInterface`) reads as a `CarbonImmutable`; a concrete class (`Carbon`, `DateTimeImmutable`) reads as that class.

The sanitization applies to every write, wherever it comes from: `Meta::of()`, `update_post_meta()`, the REST API, the block editor. A value it cannot read is emptied, and an empty meta reads as the property's default.

## Reading and writing

`Meta::of()` gives the meta of one post or term, with their PHP types:

```php
use App\Cms\PostTypes\Event;
use Pollora\Support\Facades\Meta;

$event = Meta::of(Event::class, $postId);

$event->capacity;                 // int
$event->soldOut;                  // bool
$event->status;                   // EventStatus
$event->startsAt?->isFuture();    // CarbonImmutable|null
$event->starts_at;                // the same meta, by its key

$event->capacity = 250;
$event->fill(['status' => EventStatus::Published, 'soldOut' => true])->save();

$event->set('startsAt', null)->save();   // null deletes a nullable meta
$event->toArray();                        // every meta, by property name
```

Values are read when first accessed, through `get_metadata_raw()`, so the object cache applies; an absent meta gives the property's default. Writes are checked at once — `$event->capacity = 'many'` throws an `InvalidMetaValueException` before anything is written — and stored by `save()` through `update_metadata()`, so sanitization, meta hooks and cache invalidation apply.

WordPress's functions keep working: `get_post_meta($postId, 'capacity', true)` still returns the stored string.

### A value that cannot be read

If the database holds a value that does not match the declared type (`"many"` for an `int`, written before the meta was declared), reading it:

- in debug mode (`APP_DEBUG=true`), throws an `InvalidMetaValueException` naming the meta, so it shows during development;
- in production, returns the property's default and logs a warning, so a damaged value never takes a page down.

## REST API

With `showInRest: true`, the meta appears under `meta` in the REST response of the post or term, with its type:

```json
{
  "id": 42,
  "meta": {
    "starts_at": "2026-11-14T09:00:00+00:00",
    "capacity": 250,
    "sold_out": false,
    "status": "published"
  }
}
```

The schema follows the type: dates have the `date-time` format and enums list their values, so a write with an unknown value is refused with a 400 error (`rest_not_in_enum`).

**A post type exposes its meta in REST only if it supports `custom-fields`**: add it to `#[Supports]`, as in the example above. Without it, WordPress leaves `meta` out of the response.

A key starting with an underscore is protected: WordPress hides it from custom fields and REST. Exposing one requires an explicit `capability`.

## Errors at discovery

A declaration WordPress cannot register is refused at discovery, and the error is logged with the class and the property named; the other meta of the project still register:

- a union type, an untyped property, or an unsupported type (arrays and objects are not supported yet);
- an enum without backing values (`enum Mood { … }` instead of `enum Mood: string { … }`);
- a non-nullable property without a default value;
- a protected key exposed in REST without a `capability`;
- `revisions: true` on a taxonomy;
- the same key declared twice, in one class or by two classes for the same post type or taxonomy.

## Not available yet

- Arrays and structured objects, validation rules.
- Meta of users, comments, and of post types or taxonomies the project does not declare (core, WooCommerce).
- Typed casts on the Eloquent models (`Pollora\Models\Post`): use `Meta::of()`.
